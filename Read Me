Hello!
In this Machine Learning model we are trying to develop a model that can successufully identify the traffic singn board.

Links(For Reference) - 
Youtube - https://youtu.be/qahpZkPlTRM
Data set taken from Kaggle  website - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign


General Instructions-

-Use Anaconda to develop the model, Create a seperate Environment in the Anaconda and install Jupyter Notebook and Python Libraries in that Environment.
-The Dataset should preferably be in the same working folder and in C drive.
-Run Traffic_app.py on PyCharm application
-To take pic through camera , copy paste the link from Traffic_app.py in the index.html file.


Deployment-
This model can either be deployed on a website where we have to manually select a pic from Test folder(More Accuracy) or take a screenshot 
through front camera of the laptop and upload it(Comparatively Less Accuracy).

Steps to make this particular model better-

-Instead of 80/20, make the model 70/20/10 (Train/Validation/Test).
-Include Validation along with Training and Testing.
-Predict the F1 Score.
-Try the same concept with Video Processing in Real Time.
